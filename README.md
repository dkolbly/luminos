# Luminos, markdown server

Luminos is a server than transform [markdown][3] documents into HTML, it was highly inspired by [werc][1] but build with less options in mind.

Here are some of Luminos' features:

* Does not require a database.
* Can serve both HTML or markdown files.
* Capable of serving multiple virtual hosts within the same process.
* Works out of the box on Linux, FreeBSD, OSX <s>and Windows</s> with or without an external web server.
* Written in [Go][2] and released as an Open Source [project][4].

## Using a precompiled binary

There are some Luminos precompiled binaries for Linux, FreeBSD and OSX that work without having [Go][2] installed.

Check out the [downloads page](https://github.com/xiam/luminos/downloads) for the file that match your OS.

Once you've downloaded the package, open a terminal to uncompress and install it:

    % cd ~/Downloads
    % tar xvzf luminos-0.3-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
    % cd luminos-0.3-darwin-x86_64
    % source install.sh

Then clone the example site from github and start Luminos:

    % mkdir -p ~/projects
    % cd ~/projects
    % git clone https://github.com/xiam/luminos.menteslibres.org.git
    % cd luminos.menteslibres.org
    % luminos

## Building Luminos

If you want to build from source, a [Go][2] development environment is required.

This will install Luminos to your ``$GOPATH/bin``

    % go get github.com/xiam/luminos
    % go install github.com/xiam/luminos

Then clone the example site from github and start Luminos:

    % mkdir -p ~/projects
    % cd ~/projects
    % git clone https://github.com/xiam/luminos.menteslibres.org.git
    % cd luminos.menteslibres.org
