# What is Luminos?

Luminos is a server than transforms [markdown][3] code into HTML code right away, it was highly inspired by [werc][1] but build with less options in mind.

Here are some of Luminos' features:

* It's the perfect tool for publishing documentation.
* Does not require a database.
* Can serve both HTML or markdown files.
* Capable of serving multiple virtual hosts within the same process.
* Works out of the box on Linux, FreeBSD, OSX <s>and Windows</s> with or without an external web server.
* Written in [Go][2] and released as an Open Source [project][4].
