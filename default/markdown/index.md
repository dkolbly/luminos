# What is Luminos?

Luminos is a server than transforms [markdown][3] code into HTML code right away, it was highly inspired by [werc][1] but built with less options in mind.

Here are some of Luminos' features:

* Does not require a database.
* Can serve both HTML or markdown files.
* Capable of working with virtual hosts.
* Works out of the box on Linux, FreeBSD, OSX ~~and Windows~~ with or without an external web server.

Luminos is written in [Go][2] and released as an Open Source [project][4].
